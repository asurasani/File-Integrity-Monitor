# File-Integrity-Monitor
1. This application will observe files to see if any unauthorized changes were made to the files. In the event changes were made, the user will get a notification. This File Integrity Monitor(FIM) will be able to see if files were editied, deleted, copied, and added.  
2. In order to create this FIM, I used Powershell due to its effectiveness in being able to carry out automating tasks, which makes building, testing, and deploying more efficient. 
3. To imporve upon this project, I would like to use REST API in order to alert the user via SMS in the event unauthorized file changes were made to the files. 

# Install and Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Open IDE that supports powershell and open files
3. Run and enjoy!
